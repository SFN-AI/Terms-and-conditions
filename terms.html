    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Service: SFN Twitter Tracker</strong><br>
    <strong>Last Updated: April 13, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to SFN Twitter Tracker (the “Service”), a Twitter tracking bot that collects tweets and delivers them to Discord. These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Service, provided by [SFN or “We,” “Us,” “Our”]. By accessing or using the Service, you (“User,” “You,” “Your”) agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1 Functionality</strong>: The Service provides publicly available tweets from Twitter (X) and delivers them to your designated Discord channel. The Service is hosted on our private server.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2 Tiers and Pricing</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard Tier</strong>: $49 per 28 days, providing access to tweets Discord delivery for up to 500 accounts. Limited to 10 members in your Discord server.</li>
            <li><strong>Pro Tier</strong>: $99 per 28 days, providing the same benefits as Standard tier, with a limit of 1000 tracked accounts, and a limit of 20 server members.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Terms</strong>: Payments are non-recurring, covering 28 days of access at a time. No automatic renewals are applied. You must manually initiate payment every 28 days to continue using the Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Method</strong>: Payments are currently accepted exclusively in Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency, calculated at the USD-to-SOL exchange rate at the time of payment, as determined by CoinGecko. Payments must be sent to the wallet address provided during the checkout process.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1</strong> The Service is intended for individual consumers, or groups of consumers up to the limit of members specified in your subscription tier. You represent that your use complies with all applicable laws.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Payment and Access</h2>
        <p><strong>3.1 Payment Process</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To access the Service, you must pay the applicable tier fee ($49 or $99) in SOL to the designated wallet address.</li>
            <li>Upon confirmation of payment (typically within 1-2 minutes after the transaction is validated on the Solana blockchain), you will receive access to the features specified by your subscription tier.</li>
            <li>Payments are non-refunded except as required by law or specified in Section 3.3.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>3.2 Exchange Rate Volatility</strong>: Due to cryptocurrency volatility, the SOL amount may vary based on the USD value at the time of payment. You are responsible for ensuring the correct USD-equivalent payment is sent. Underpayments may delay access; overpayments will not be refunded unless requested within 7 days.</p>
        <p><strong>3.3 Refunds</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Refunds are not provided for completed payments unless the Service is unavailable for more than 24 hours due to our fault.</li>
            <li>To request a refund, contact us at sfn_ai@protonmail.com or by opening a ticket on the Official SFN Discord Server within 7 days of payment, providing your Discord Server ID, and the wallet address you wish the refund to be paid into.</li>
            <li>Refunds, if approved, will be issued in SOL, equivalent to the USD value of the subscription fee proportional to the downtime (e.g., 3 days of downtime out of 28 days equals approximately 10% of the subscription fee), to the wallet address from which the payment was made.</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>3.4 Access Duration</strong>: Each payment grants access for 28 days from the date of payment confirmation. You must renew manually to continue using the Service.</p>
